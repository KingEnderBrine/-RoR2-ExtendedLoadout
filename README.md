# Description
Does what some people think `ExtraSkillSlots` does: adds an additional row of skills for vanilla characters, so you can use both skill variants.

# Exceptions
* `Engineer` - not adding an extra slot for turrets.
* `MUL-T` - nothing is added.
* `Captain` - nothing is added.

# Configs (and modded characters)
By default configs are configured to add skills only for vanilla characters (with exceptions listed above).
You can enable extra skills for modded characters in corresponding config sections.
